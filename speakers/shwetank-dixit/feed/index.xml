				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>It&#8217;s 2016 and we still are talking about native vs web. Shouldn&#8217;t this debate be settled by now? Shouldn&#8217;t the web have won  by now? In many ways it has, but unfortunately, it was missing a few key features which made native appear better in some key aspects. The good news is that we now have a lot of great things to finally make a viable web app compete with native ones in most of these aspects. With the concept of Progressive Web Apps, the Web is giving us the capability to do more. We&#8217;ll see what exactly we could do with Progressive Web apps to build the future of the web. Along the way, we&#8217;ll see what expectations the Web might have from us, and whether we could measure up to them.</div>
