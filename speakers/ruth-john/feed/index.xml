You can find it in hardware, music, art, museums and even on aircraft! In this interactive talk we take a look at a project which took JavaScript to the streets, projecting live visuals to music in a *Portable Audio Visual Pack*. We\u2019ll break down the software built for the project, which involves audio triggered visuals using the Web Audio API and Web Animation API, with anything you can think of to build in the browser: pure HTML &amp;amp; CSS, SVG and canvas, plus video and images. Then we learn how to mix these visuals, to music, live! You\u2019ll even have a chance to get involve yourself, using your own device - it is the web after all. How do you pick this all up and carry it around the streets you ask? Don\u2019t worry we\u2019ll cover that too. Come and play with some fabulous street art code - it\u2019ll be fun, you\u2019ll learn some cool JavaScript and you\u2019ll be inspired.&quot;}" data-sheets-userformat="{&quot;2&quot;:9089,&quot;3&quot;:[null,0],&quot;10&quot;:0,&quot;11&quot;:4,&quot;12&quot;:0,&quot;16&quot;:8}">JavaScript is everywhere!
